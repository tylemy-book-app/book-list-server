# Book App - Server Side

**Author**: Tyler Fishbone && Jeremy Crawford
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This application highlights some of the creator's favorite books, and gives the user access to Title, Author, ISBN, and a short description. This particular repository serves as the Controller between the Model and the View.

## Getting Started
To get started on building this application, the developer would need to establish Heroku and GitHub accounts so s/he can deploy the app to the web free of cost. The user also needs to install Postgre on their machine so they can populate a datatable to push to Heroku. Then, code :)

## Architecture
Languages used: JavaScript with jQuery, HTML, CSS, SQL
Libraries used: Node.JS, Express, PG
Programs used: Postgre, Heroku, GitHub, Nodemon
